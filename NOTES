system calls all go from user->kernel space thru the function here:
  http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.24.6/arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S
  L190

use kprobe? or else it might get hairy messing with that assembly bc 1) its
assembly and 2) messing up here means nothing can make syscalls, i.e. init
can't even run.
